    "Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
    Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    All the King's horses, and all the King's men,
    Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty together again."


After Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall and all the King's horses and all
the King's men could not put him together again, Little Dumpty
lived with his Mother, who was called Widow Dumpty, and went to school
every day. He set off in good time every morning--even if it was
_pouring_ with rain. He had a great many friends at school, and the boys
liked him because he always had plenty of marbles, and used to carry
sticky labels in his pocket; he got them out of his Mother's shop, and
gave them as prizes for racing and jumping in play time.
